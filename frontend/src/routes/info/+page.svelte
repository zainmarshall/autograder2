  <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Intro to CP &amp; In-Houses</h1>
  <p>Competitive programming contests involve competitors submitting a single file (.cpp, .py, .java, etc.) that accepts input and prints output from/to the system. A tutorial on how this would work on <a href="https://codeforces.com" class="text-indigo-400 underline hover:text-indigo-300">codeforces.com</a> is located here. The grader (<a href="https://tjctgrader.org" class="text-indigo-400 underline hover:text-indigo-300">tjctgrader.org</a>) maintained by Computer Team officers functions in a similar manner as the Codeforces contest system.</p>

  <p>We will host contests (in-houses) on our grader website. Some will be rated and others unrated. Rated contests will impact your overall standing that is used to calculate rankings for travel competition team selection to represent TJ. Other variables in the ranking calculation may include USACO division and Codeforces rating. You can see the dates these in-house will occur in the schedule in the public Google Drive.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl fon   t-bold mt-8 mb-2">Rankings Formula (2024-2025)</h2>
  <p><strong>Tentative formula is:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Data is taken from grader website</li>
    <li>Codeforces rating is simply the max rating of your account.</li>
    <li>Each USACO division is mapped to a rating where Bronze/Not Participated → 800, Silver → 1200, Gold → 1600, Platinum → 1900.</li>
    <li>Each user gets a rating for every rated in-house contest, which is <span class="font-mono">1200# of participants in contest-rank in contest+1# of participants in contest+800</span>, linearly mapping rank to a rating in the interval (800, 2000]. If you do not participate in the contest, you get a 0.</li>
    <li>Your overall rating for in-houses is the average of all your ratings, with <span class="font-mono">max(0, min(2, # of contests-2))</span> drops. This means after 3 contests have happened, your overall rating will not include your lowest score and after 4 contests, your overall rating will not include your lowest two scores. Problem setters will get one extra drop for each rated contest they have been an author of.</li>
    <li>Your final index is a <span class="font-mono">0.2, 0.35, 0.45</span> weighted average of USACO, Codeforces, and In-Houses, weighting your higher values more.</li>
    <li>Problemsetters for the first rated contest will have to drop it, so their rating will be a <span class="font-mono">0.4, 0.6</span> weighted average of USACO and Codeforces</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-2">Travel Competitions</h2>
  <p>The in-person competitions we are very likely to send teams to are Widener, Code Quest, PClassic, UMD HSPC, VCU HSPC, and UVA HSPC. If there are any other contests you think we should attend, let us know. The application forms for these will be posted on Facebook and Discord a few weeks before the competition. Below is additional information on each contest based on past years, which may change. By default, you are not allowed to use electronic tools to do anything besides type code or view documentation and pre-written code is not allowed.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>We send at least 3 teams of 3, one of which is a freshman team. The competition doesn’t have an actual online judge, you just run input/output locally through VSCode, Eclipse, etc. on your computer (one per team).</li>
    <li>To submit, you raise your hand and they come to your table, give you one or two inputs as tests, and look to see if the output is correct.</li>
    <li>You only get one submission per problem, plus one other extra submission.</li>
    <li>You are not allowed to access web browsers, the internet, or other electronic devices.</li>
