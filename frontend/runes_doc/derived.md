Derived state is declared with the $derived rune:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let doubled = $derived(count * 2);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	{doubled}
</button>

<p>{count} doubled is {doubled}</p>
The expression inside $derived(...) should be free of side-effects. Svelte will disallow state changes (e.g. count++) inside derived expressions.

As with $state, you can mark class fields as $derived.

Code in Svelte components is only executed once at creation. Without the $derived rune, doubled would maintain its original value even when count changes.

$derived.by
Sometimes you need to create complex derivations that don’t fit inside a short expression. In these cases, you can use $derived.by which accepts a function as its argument.


<script>
	let numbers = $state([1, 2, 3]);
	let total = $derived.by(() => {
		let total = 0;
		for (const n of numbers) {
			total += n;
		}
		return total;
	});
</script>

<button onclick={() => numbers.push(numbers.length + 1)}>
	{numbers.join(' + ')} = {total}
</button>
In essence, $derived(expression) is equivalent to $derived.by(() => expression).

Understanding dependencies
Anything read synchronously inside the $derived expression (or $derived.by function body) is considered a dependency of the derived state. When the state changes, the derived will be marked as dirty and recalculated when it is next read.

To exempt a piece of state from being treated as a dependency, use untrack.

Overriding derived values
Derived expressions are recalculated when their dependencies change, but you can temporarily override their values by reassigning them (unless they are declared with const). This can be useful for things like optimistic UI, where a value is derived from the ‘source of truth’ (such as data from your server) but you’d like to show immediate feedback to the user:


<script>
	let { post, like } = $props();

	let likes = $derived(post.likes);

	async function onclick() {
		// increment the `likes` count immediately...
		likes += 1;

		// and tell the server, which will eventually update `post`
		try {
			await like();
		} catch {
			// failed! roll back the change
			likes -= 1;
		}
	}
</script>

<button {onclick}>🧡 {likes}</button>
Prior to Svelte 5.25, deriveds were read-only.

Deriveds and reactivity
Unlike $state, which converts objects and arrays to deeply reactive proxies, $derived values are left as-is. For example, in a case like this...


let items = $state([...]);

let index = $state(0);
let selected = $derived(items[index]);
...you can change (or bind: to) properties of selected and it will affect the underlying items array. If items was not deeply reactive, mutating selected would have no effect.

Destructuring
If you use destructuring with a $derived declaration, the resulting variables will all be reactive — this...


let { a, b, c } = $derived(stuff());
...is roughly equivalent to this:


let _stuff = $derived(stuff());
let a = $derived(_stuff.a);
let b = $derived(_stuff.b);
let c = $derived(_stuff.c);
Update propagation
Svelte uses something called push-pull reactivity — when state is updated, everything that depends on the state (whether directly or indirectly) is immediately notified of the change (the ‘push’), but derived values are not re-evaluated until they are actually read (the ‘pull’).

If the new value of a derived is referentially identical to its previous value, downstream updates will be skipped. In other words, Svelte will only update the text inside the button when large changes, not when count changes, even though large depends on count:


<script>
	let count = $state(0);
	let large = $derived(count > 10);
</script>

<button onclick={() => count++}>
	{large}
</button>
